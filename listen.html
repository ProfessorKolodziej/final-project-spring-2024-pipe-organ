		<h2> Organ Stop Descriptions</h2>
		<p> The Principal 16' is a deep supportive sound that is often played on the pedalboard with the organist's feed.
			It is called 16 because its pipes are twice as long as the Principal 8'. </p>
		<p> Vox Celeste means voice of the sky. A celeste stop plays multiple pipes together to make its special sound.
		</p>
		<p> Principal 8' is the classic pipe organ sound. A middle C pipe is really 8 feet tall! </p>
		<p> Nazard is a mixture stop where multiple pipes sound together to create an illusion of sound. </p>
		<p> The Trumpet 8' is usually a loud solo stop that sounds exactly like the brass instrument it is named after.
